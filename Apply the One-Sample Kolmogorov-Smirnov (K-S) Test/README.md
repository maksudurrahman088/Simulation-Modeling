📝 Problem Statement
In this assignment, I worked with the following dataset of daily temperatures (in °C) recorded over 10 days:

The objective was to determine whether the data comes from a normal distribution using the One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test.


📌 Tasks:


Load and visualize the dataset.

- Standardize the data using mean and standard deviation.

- Perform the K-S test against a standard normal distribution.

- Output the K-S test statistic and p-value.

- Plot the empirical CDF versus the standard normal CDF.

- Conclude whether the null hypothesis should be rejected at a 0.05 significance level.


🎯 What I Learned



✅ Performing a K-S Test:
I learned how to apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the normality of a dataset.

✅ Standardizing Data:
I practiced centering and scaling data using mean and standard deviation to prepare it for statistical testing.

✅ Using scipy.stats.kstest:
I used Python’s scipy.stats library to perform the K-S test and extract meaningful statistics.

✅ CDF Comparison:
I visualized how empirical data distributions compare to theoretical ones using cumulative distribution functions.

✅ Hypothesis Interpretation:
I interpreted results using p-values and test statistics to evaluate if the dataset fits a normal distribution.

✅ Real-World Application:
This assignment improved my ability to apply statistical hypothesis testing in practical data analysis scenarios.
