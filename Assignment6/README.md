ðŸ“˜ Simulation Problem Set
1. Monte Carlo Simulation (Inventory Management)
Scenario:
LatinOrg Inc. places an order every 2 weeks to restock up to 100 units. Costs include:

Order cost: $50

Product cost: $4/unit

Holding cost: $1/unit/week

Selling price: $12

Inventory distribution:

Inventory	Probability
15	          0.12
25	          0.25
35           	0.35
40          	0.20
42	          0.06
55	          0.02

Tasks:

a) Simulate 60 weeks â†’ estimate average order size

b) Calculate total cost (ordering + product + holding)

2. Single Server Queueing
Tasks:

Simulate M/M/1 queue for 200 customers (Î» = 3, Î¼ = 4) â†’ get avg. waiting time & utilization

Increase load (Î» = 8, Î¼ = 6) â†’ analyze overload effect

Limit queue to 10 â†’ measure rejected customers & waiting time
